# 📌 Weather Information Dashboard  
### Built by **Aditya Nanda**

A dynamic Weather Information Dashboard built using React and the **useEffect** hook to fetch and display real-time weather data from an external API. This application allows users to search for any city by name and instantly view live weather conditions with a clean, responsive UI.
